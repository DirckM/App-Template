> **Note**: This template supports both iOS and Android. However, native code instructions are provided only for Android, as Xcode (required for iOS native Swift code) was not available during development.

## Steps for Building the App

### Creating the Expo App

To start, visit the Expo website to set up your project. Consider whether your app requires native code for features like accessing screen time data:

- **Expo Classic**: Suitable for apps without native code requirements.
- **Expo EAS (Expo Application Service)**: Recommended for this template, as it supports all Expo Classic features plus additional capabilities:
  - Publishing apps to the App Store and Play Store.
  - Custom native code integration.
  - Custom development clients.

To create an Expo project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest your-app-name
```

This command sets up a new React Native project with the following included:
- Expo package and CLI for development.
- Expo Router for basic tab navigation.
- Multi-platform support (Android, iOS, and web).
- TypeScript configured by default.

> **Note**: TypeScript is pre-configured, so no additional setup is required.

To remove the default boilerplate code and replace it with a minimal structure, navigate to your app folder and run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the boilerplate code to an `app-example` folder. Confirm by entering `y` when prompted.

### Initializing EAS

To enable EAS for native code support and advanced features, install the latest EAS CLI:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

Check for EAS CLI updates using the same command. Then, log in to your Expo account:

```bash
eas login
```

If you donâ€™t have an Expo account, create one at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/). A successful login will display a confirmation.

Configure the EAS build by running:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

This prompts:
- Whether to create an EAS project for `@username/app-name` (default: `Y`).
- Which platforms to configure for EAS Build (`All`, `iOS`, or `Android`).

This generates an `eas.json` file with your EAS configuration.

Next, install the Expo development client for custom builds:

```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

This module enables custom native code support, unlike the default Expo Go app.

### Running the App

Ensure Android Studio is installed for Android emulation. Run the app using:

```bash
expo run:android
```

or, for iOS (if applicable):

```bash
expo run:ios
```

When prompted, specify the Android package name (e.g., `com.username.your-app-name`). This command runs the Expo prebuild process, generating an `android` folder for native code if needed.

#### **Error 1**
Now during the running of this command we got an error that there was a similar theme name in the types. This was located at: 'expo-app_template/android/app/main/res/values/styles.xml' Here we could see to similar theme names: AppTheme, so we changed one to 'LightAppTheme'
After doing this you have to navigiate to the Android folder ( \expo-app-template\android )in the project and then run the following command:

```bash
.\gradlew.bat clean

```
Then we again 'cd ..' out of the Andorid folder and into the expo-app-template folder and run the 'expo run:android' again

#### **ERROR 2**
Then we got another error which says that we cann't have the '.webp' format and the '.png' in one folder. So what we do is we move to the file path:
- expo-app-template\android\app\src\main\res\
Here we see all kinds of folders with mipmap.... What we have to do is delete either one of them. So only the '.png' or the '.webp'.

#### **ERROR 3**
Then you might also have another error which indicated a fault in the 'AndroidManifest.xml'. When we do all this it lists the package like so:
- package="com.dirckmulder.expoapptemplate"
Delete this to get rid of the error.
